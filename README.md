**About flal**

This is a tiny tool used to convert convert flac audio libraries into mp3 or m4a files. It will iterate over a given set of files and either convert these into single output files or, depending on the metadata of the source flac files, create a single large output file from multiple input files, for example from an audio book.

All this is a conversion from an older ruby script and currently in experimental status.
